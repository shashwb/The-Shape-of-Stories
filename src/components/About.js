    <h1>What Is All This Here About?</h1>

    <p>
     This blog is a loose collection of essays, videos and podcasts with no planned coherence.
     The eventual cosmic fate of these ideas is to become contributions
     to the <b>Chrono-Synclastic Infundibulae</b>,
     wherever they may exist throughout our galaxy.
    </p>

    <p>Some explanation of terms:</p>

    <p>
      From novelist and scruffy hair enthusiast Kurt Vonnegut's <i>Sirens of Titan</i>, a <b>Chrono-Synclastic Infundibulum</b> is described as the following:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>
        "<b><i>Chrono</i></b> means time. 
         <b><i> Synclastic</i></b> means curved towards the same side in all directions, like the skin of an orange. 
         <b><i> Infundibulum</i></b> is what ancient Romans like Julius Caesar and Nero called a funnel..."
        </i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
     Vonnegut describes places in our Universe where all of the myriad lowercase "t" and capital "T" truths co-exist in contradictory harmony to each other, colliding into metaphorical helixes, like philosophical DNA strands. Vonnegut again:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>
          "These places are where all the different kinds of truths fit togther as nicely as the parts in your ... solar watch."
        </i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      There are nooks and crannies within our own minds where all kinds of truths fit together. We are exceptional at keeping a harmonious cognitive dissonance, which I theorize is part of our strategy to scoff at an uncaring universe, to sneer at the cosmic last laugh.
      
      I like the idea that there is a physical place (or places!) where the Universe has decided to do a little consideration of it's own, like a giant cosmic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thinker">The Thinker</a> sculpture.
      All good fiction is based on wishful thinking! These <b>Shapes of Stories</b>, as well, represent an honest attempt, goddammit, at wishful thinking.

    <p>
    The goal is to have a good heuristic for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imitating_art#cite_note-McGrath1999-1"><i>feel of life</i></a>, through all of it's component parts.
     What <i>shapes</i> do they take? In my life, they take the shape of the fantastical creativity of video games, the cringy-coolness of anime, the immersive trance of novels or the fantastical imagination of movies and television.
      <br/>
      <br/>
        So now the bad news: still a bit fuzzy on where the closest <b>Chrono-Synclastic Infundibulum</b> actually is... If anyone knows a good inter-galactic literary agent, let's do lunch.

       Oh, And consider donating, I can't imagine postage to Uranus is cheap.
